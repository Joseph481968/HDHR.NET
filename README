HDHR.NET is a managed wrapper for libhdhomerun written in C++ CLI. It allows
all languages running under the Common Language Runtime (C#, VB, F#, etc.) to
control HDHomeRun devices. This library does not expose all functionality of
libhdhomerun, but instead tries to provide support for commonly used features
with an interface that is familiar for .NET programmers.

libhdhomerun is a C library by SiliconDust to control their HDHomeRun line of
network-attached TV tuners.

This library was developed and tested with Visual C++ 2008 Express.
 - It should work with Visual C++ 2010 Express with the project conversion
   wizard.
 - It may work with Visual C++ 2005 Express with a custom project file.
 - It definitely will not compile with Visual Studio .NET 2003 or prior.
